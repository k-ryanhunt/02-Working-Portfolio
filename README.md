# Working-Portfolio

## What is the Working-Portfolio project about?

For this project, I was tasked with creating a starting point for my portfolio.  We'll continuously update this website with our work throughout the coding bootcamp.  It should be a landing page for all of my deployed websites.  **For this task, we were able to be creative and make it visually look how we wanted it to.**  This allowed me to experiment with different layouts, colors, and CSS properties that I typically wouldn't utlize.

## How did I do it?

I first started with a section briefly describing who I am and how I came out to Denver.  I created a placeholders for now that I can easily swap out later on.  I plugged in photographs that I have taken since moving to Colorado.  I created a contact form so that potential employers can send me a message if they are interested in having me work for them.

## What functionality should the website have?

1. It should present my name, a photo of myself, and how to contact me.
2. The navigation links should jump to the corresponding section on the website.
3. It should have links that take you to the live website of my projects.
4. They would like for the first web application's image to be bigger than the others.
