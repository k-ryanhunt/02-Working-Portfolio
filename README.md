# Working-Portfolio

## What is the Working-Portfolio project about?

For this project, I was tasked with creating a starting point for my portfolio.  We'll continuously update this website with our work throughout the coding bootcamp.  It should be a landing page for all of my deployed websites.

## How did I do it?

I created a website with placeholders for now that I can easily swap out later on.  I plugged in photographs that I have taken since moving to Colorado.

## What functionality should the website have?

1. It should present my name, a photo of myself, and how to contact me.
2. The navigation links should jump to the corresponding section on the website.
3. It should have links that take you to the live website of my projects.
